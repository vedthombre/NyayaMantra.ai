                LAW, COURTS AND THE CONSTITUTION
            </h2>
            <p>India’s commitment to the rule of law is grounded in the Constitution which establishes India as a
                ‘Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic’ with a Parliamentary form of Government. The
                Constitution of India is the supreme legal authority which binds the legislative, executive, and
                judicial organs of government. The Constitution grants all citizens Fundamental Rights and empowers the
                independent judiciary to invalidate legislations or government actions which violate the Constitution.
                Some of the other key features of the Constitution are a federal system of governance between the Union
                and the States, separation of powers between the three organs of the Government, free and fair
                elections, equality before the law, and a secular state that recognizes freedom of conscience and
                religion.
            </p>
            <div class="col-2">
            </div>
            <h2 class="heading2 box-style1 border1 accent-border-color border-top0 border-right0 pd-bottom5 pd-top5">
                SOURCES OF LAW
            </h2>
            <p>The Constitution of India is the source of legal authority and empowers Parliament and the Legislatures
                of States and Union Territories to enact statutes. There is also a vast body of laws known as
                subordinate legislation in the form of rules, regulations, and by-laws made by Central and State
                Governments and local authorities like Municipal Corporations, Municipalities, Gram Panchayats and other
                local bodies. This subordinate legislation is made under the authority conferred or delegated either by
                Parliament or the concerned Legislature of the State or Union Territory. The decisions of the Supreme
                Court are binding on all Courts within the territory of India. As India is a land of diversities, local
                customs and conventions which do not contradict a statute or the Constitution are recognised and taken
                into account by Courts while administering justice in certain spheres.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading2 box-style1 border1 accent-border-color border-top0 border-right0 pd-bottom5 pd-top5">
                ENACTMENT OF LAWS
            </h2>
            <p>The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution contains three lists: a Union List, a State List, and a
                Concurrent List. These lists set out the various subjects on which Parliament and State Legislatures are
                empowered to make laws. The Indian Parliament is competent to make laws on matters enumerated in the
                Union List. State Legislatures are competent to make laws on matters enumerated in the State List. While
                both the Union and the States have the power to legislate on matters enumerated in the Concurrent List,
                only Parliament has power to make laws on matters not included in the State List or the Concurrent List.
                In the event of repugnancy, laws made by Parliament shall prevail over laws made by State Legislatures,
                to the extent of the repugnancy. The State law shall be void unless it has received the assent of the
                President, and in such case, shall prevail in that State.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading2 box-style1 border1 accent-border-color border-top0 border-right0 pd-bottom5 pd-top5">
                APPLICABILITY OF LAWS
            </h2>
            <p>Laws made by Parliament may extend throughout or in any part of the territory of India and those made by
                State Legislatures generally apply only within the territory of the State concerned. Hence, variations
                are likely to exist from State to State in provisions of law relating to matters falling in the State
                and Concurrent Lists.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading2 box-style1 border1 accent-border-color border-top0 border-right0 pd-bottom5 pd-top5">
                JUDICIARY
            </h2>
            <p>One of the unique features of the Indian Constitution is that, notwithstanding the adoption of a federal
                system and existence of Union and State Acts in their respective spheres, it provides for a single
                integrated system of courts to administer both Union and State laws. At the apex of the entire judicial
                system is the Supreme Court of India followed by the High Courts in each State or group of States. Under
                the administration of each High Court are the District Courts. Village/Panchayat Courts also function in
                some States under various names like Nyaya Panchayat, Gram Nyayalaya, Gram Kachheri to decide civil and
                criminal disputes of petty and local nature. Each State is divided into judicial districts presided over
                by a District and Sessions Judge, which is the principal civil court of original jurisdiction and can
                try all offences including those punishable with death. The District and Sessions Judge is the highest
                judicial authority in a district. District Courts have courts of civil jurisdiction, presided over by
                judges known in different States as Munsifs, Sub-Judges, Civil Judges. Similarly, the classes of
                criminal courts include the Chief Judicial Magistrates and Judicial Magistrates of First and Second
                Class.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading2 box-style1 border1 accent-border-color border-top0 border-right0 pd-bottom5 pd-top5">
                CONSTITUTION OF SUPREME COURT
            </h2>
            <p>The Supreme Court of India comprises the Chief Justice of India and not more than 33 other Judges
                appointed by the President of India. Supreme Court Judges retire at the age of 65. In order to be
                appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court, a person must be a citizen of India and must have been, for
                at least five years, a Judge of a High Court or an Advocate of a High Court for at least 10 years or he
                must be, in the opinion of the President, a distinguished jurist. The Constitution also contains
                provisions for a Judge of the High Court who may be appointed as an ad-hoc Judge of the Supreme Court
                and for retired Judges of the Supreme Court or High Courts to sit and act as Judges of that Court. The
                independence of judiciary is part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution. A Supreme Court
                Judge cannot be removed from office except by an order of the President passed after an address in each
                House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of
                not less than two-thirds of members present and voting, and presented to the President in the same
                Session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehavior or incapacity. A person who has been a
                Judge of the Supreme Court is debarred from practicing in any court of law or before any other authority
                in India.
            </p>

                SUPREME COURT REGISTRY
            </h2>
            <p>The administrative wing of the Supreme Court is known as the Registry. For systematic functioning and
                efficient disposal of work, the Registry is divided into two main wings, viz. Administration and
                Judicial, which are further divided into various Divisions, Branches, Sections and Cells. The
                administrative power for determining the work structure of the Court and the Registry exclusively vests
                in the Chief Justice of India. The Secretary General who is of the rank of Secretary to the Government
                of India is the highest Administrative Officer of the Supreme Court. He is assisted by
                Registrars/Officers on Special Duty and Additional Registrars who are assigned work of specific branches
                and they, in turn, are assisted by Deputy Registrars, Assistant Registrars and other officers/staff.

                ATTORNEY GENERAL
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Attorney General of India is the highest law officer of the country appointed by the President. He
                shall be a person qualified to be appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court. It is the duty of the
                Attorney General of India to give advice to the Government of India upon such legal matters and to
                perform such other duties of legal character as may be referred or assigned to him by the President. In
                the performance of his duties, he has the right of audience in all Courts in India as well as the right
                to take part in the proceedings of Parliament without the right to vote. In discharge of his functions,
                the Attorney General is assisted by a Solicitor General and Additional Solicitors Generals.

                AMICUS CURIAE
            </h2>
            <p>If a petition is received from the jail or in any other criminal matter where the accused is
                unrepresented, then an Advocate is appointed as amicus curiae by the Court to defend and argue the case
                of the accused. In civil matters, the Court can appoint an Advocate as amicus curiae if it thinks it
                necessary in case of an unrepresented party. Courts can also appoint amicus curiae in any matter of
                general public importance or in which the interest of the public at large is involved.

                        <p>
                            Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891-1956) was born on 14 April 1891 in Mhow Cantonment,
                            Madhya Pradesh. He completed his primary schooling in Satara, Maharashtra and
                            completed his secondary education from Elphinstone High School in Bombay. His
                            education was achieved in the face of significant discrimination, for he belonged to
                            the Scheduled Caste (then considered as ‘untouchables’). In his autobiographical
                            note ‘Waiting for a Visa’, he recalled how he was not allowed to drink water from
                            the common water tap at his school, writing, “no peon, no water”.
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr Ambedkar graduated from Bombay University in 1912 with a B.A. in Economics and Political
                            Science. On account of his excellent performance at college, in 1913 he was awarded a
                            scholarship by Sayajirao Gaikwad, then Maharaja (King) of Baroda state to pursue his M.A.
                            and Ph.D. at Columbia University in New York, USA. His Master’s thesis in 1916 was titled
                            “The Administration and Finance of the East India Company”. He submitted his Ph.D. thesis on
                            “The Evolution of Provincial Finance in India: A Study in the Provincial Decentralization of
                            Imperial Finance”.
                        </p>
                        <p>After Columbia, Dr. Ambedkar moved to London, where he registered at the London School of
                            Economics and Political Science (LSE) to study economics, and enrolled in Grey’s Inn to
                            study law. However, due to lack of funds, he had to return to India in 1917. In 1918, he
                            became a Professor of Political Economy at Sydenham College, Mumbai (erstwhile Bombay).
                            During this time, he submitted a statement to the Southborough Committee demanding universal
                            adult franchise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1920, with the financial assistance from Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj of Kolhapur, a
                            personal loan from a friend and his savings from his time in India, Dr. Ambedkar returned to
                            London to complete his education. In 1922, he was called to the bar and became a
                            barrister-at-law. He also completed his M.S.c. and D.S.c. from the LSE. His doctoral thesis
                            was later published as “The Problem of the Rupee”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After his return to India, Dr Ambedkar founded Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha (Society for
                            Welfare of the Ostracized) and led social movements such as Mahad Satyagraha in 1927 to
                            demand justice and equal access to public resources for the historically oppressed castes of
                            the Indian society. In the same year, he entered the Bombay Legislative Council as a
                            nominated member.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsequently, Dr. Ambedkar made his submissions before the Indian Statutory Commission also
                            known as the ‘Simon Commission’ on constitutional reforms in 1928. The reports of the Simon
                            Commission resulted in the three roundtable conferences between 1930-32, where Dr. Ambedkar
                            was invited to make his submissions.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1935, Dr. Ambedkar was appointed as the Principal of Government Law College, Mumbai, where
                            he was teaching as a Professor since 1928. Thereafter, he was appointed as the Labour Member
                            (1942-46) in the Viceroy’s Executive Council.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1946, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly of India. On 15 August 1947, he took oath
                            as the first Law Minister of independent India. Subsequently, he was elected Chairperson of
                            the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly, and steered the process of drafting of
                            India’s Constitution. Mahavir Tyagi, a member of the Constituent Assembly, described Dr.
                            Ambedkar as “the main artist” who “laid aside his brush and unveiled the picture for the
                            public to see and comment upon”. Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who presided over the Constituent
                            Assembly and later became the first President of the Indian Republic, said: “Sitting in the
                            Chair and watching the proceedings from day to day, I have realised as nobody else could
                            have, with what zeal and devotion the members of the Drafting Committee and especially its
                            Chairman, Dr. Ambedkar in spite of his indifferent health, have worked. We could never make
                            a decision which was or could be ever so right as when we put him on the Drafting Committee
                            and made him its Chairman. He has not only justified his selection but has added luster to
                            the work which he has done.”
                        </p>
                        <p>After the first General Election in 1952, he became a member of the Rajya Sabha. He was also
                            awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Columbia University in the same year. In 1953, he
                            was also awarded another honorary doctorate from Osmania University, Hyderabad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Ambedkar’s health worsened in 1955 due to prolonged illness. He passed away in his sleep
                            on 6 December 1956 in Delhi.
